### The interesting story of Brock Pierce

In 2001, way before the release of Bitcoin (2009), [Brock Pierce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brock_Pierce), co-founder of EOS and chairman of the Bitcoin foundation has pioneered the field of in-game asset monetization creating Internet Gaming Entertainment Ltd (IGE). Started for digitial assets in the game EverQuest, [IGE offered not only the virtual commodities in exchange for real money but also provided professional customer service.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_economy#Black_market). A very lucrative underground market of virtual commodities, a so called [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_economy#Black_market](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_economy#Black_market) emerged with IGE enjoying a central position. Going against game manufacturer's terms and condition, IGE was on the edge of legality. Big players of the gaming industry, with Blizzard Entertainement on the forefront, went into a raging battle starting in 2007 to try to put an end to this "black market". This secondary market has shrinked a lot since then due to these efforts.

Part of the efforts to circumvent the secondary market was to include such virtual assets trading features inside the game itself and to modify the game monetization strategies accordingly. For exemple, in 2011, Blizzard introduced its own market place for digital assets inside Diablo III via a currency-based auction house called... the Auction House. Later, [by 2015, Blizzard attempted to stabilize the in-game economy of World of Warcraft by introducing the WoW Token, which let players exchange virtual gold for real currency.](https://cryptobriefing.com/video-games-mining-cryptocurrency/). This shows that the big players of the industry has realized it is not worth going againts this trend and that they should instead try to make a profit out of it. In fact, many of the small players in this industry had understood this earlier, especially the mobile game devellopers. For example, free-to-play games are now becoming main-stream, especially on mobile platforms, and the way profit is generated in these games is through the purchase of in-game assets by the player. Monetization of games is evolving rapidly and will continue to do so. 

### Gamers as early adopters
But in-game tokens and assets introduced by game manufacturers are not cryptoeconomic tokens. Since the code converning the exchange is closed-source and the trading history is stored on centralized server, these tokens totaly lack transparency. For the average consumer, transparency is not that much of an issue, but for players having a lot of stake in the game, it can be a major concern. More and more gamers in the community start to be worried about transparency concerning there virtual assets and start to be sensible to the advantages blockchain technologies can bring to their gaming experience. It is not a surprise that the proportion of token holders in the gaming community is very high compared to the general public. 

Gamers represents a huge bassin of potential early adopters for blockchain technologies and cryptocurrencies. Monetization of in-games assets is a convincing use-case of blockchain beyong Bitcoin and will eventually have a central role to play in the come back of the in-game asset virtual market that is currently preparing for 2019. Some analyst say that the price fluctuations of cryptocurrencies will eventually be dampened when the gaming industry starts adopting cryptocurrencies massively. According to the specialist, blockchain is at the edge of a first wave of mass adoption. This is very exiting times for the blockchain community. But we have to be prepared for this. So now, let's talk blockchain. 

### The current state of blockchain games
Since the release of Ethereum in 2015, we have witnessed the emergence of games on the blockchain which fullfill these transparency requirements. The popularity of these blockchain games is undeniable (crypto zombies, crypto kitties, etc.) despite the obvious lack of gameplay of these early games and their primitive game mechanics. Blockchain games are here to stay and will become more and more diverse, complexe and fun beyong the simple "hot potato style" and speculative games. But technological constrains remain that hinders the devellopers from offering a satisfying user experience to the player. These concerns are at the hearth of wide spread blockchain adoption in the near future:

1. Transaction fees
2. Transaction rate
3. Private key and account management

## 2. Tutorial: building a simple tic tac toe on the blockchain

Through this workshop, we will explore these issues by building a simple blockchain game, namely tic-tac-toe.

blockchain technology might be the next big thing in that space. The gaming market is huge and e-sports popularity is growing.
