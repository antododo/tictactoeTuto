# Blockchain and games event 

## 1. Introductory talk

### The interesting story of Brock Pierce
Monetization of in games assets was one of the first convincing use case of the blockchain beyong Bitcoin. [Brock Pierce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brock_Pierce), co-founder of EOS and chairman of the Bitcoin foundation has pioneered this field in 2001 by creating Internet Gaming Entertainment Ltd (IGE). Started for digitial assets in the game EverQuest, [IGE offered not only the virtual commodities in exchange for real money but also provided professional customer service.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_economy#Black_market). A very lucrative underground market was then created with IGE enjoying a central position. Going against many games manifacturer's terms and condition, IGE was on the edge of legality. Big players of the gaming industry with Blizzard Entertainement on the forefront, went into a raging battle between 2007 and 2010 to try to put an end to this "black market". 

But more recently, in 2011, Blizzard introduced its own market place for digital assets inside Diablo III via a currency-based auction house call the Auction House. Later, in 2014, [By 2015, Blizzard attempted to stabilize the in-game economy of World of Warcraft by introducing the WoW Token, which let players exchange virtual gold for real currency.](https://cryptobriefing.com/video-games-mining-cryptocurrency/). This chooses that the big players of the industry had to realize that its is not worth going againts this trend and that they should instead try to make a profit out of it. 

But the in-game token is not a cryptoeconomic token, but for the average consumer, it has all the attributes of it. But more and more gamers in the community start to be worried about transparency of these tokens. An transparency is 

### Gamers as early adopters
The proportion of token holders in the gaming community is very high compared to the general public. This represents a bassin of potential early adopters for blockchain technologies.

### The current state of blockchain games
The popularity of blockchain games is undeniable (crypto zombies, crypto kitties, etc.) despite the lack depth of these games in terms of game mechanics and gameplay. Blockchain games are here to stay and will become more and more diverse beyong simple "hot potato style" and speculative games.

### Now the main focus of the workshop: user experience 
Blockchain games demands high performance on the underlying back-end to offer seamless experience to the user (high transaction rate, secure private key and account management, low or unexistant transaction fees). These concerns are at the hearth of wide spread blockchain adoption in the near future.
