### The interesting story of Brock Pierce

In 2001, way before the release of Bitcoin (2009), [Brock Pierce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brock_Pierce), co-founder of EOS and chairman of the Bitcoin foundation has pioneered the field of in-game asset monetization creating Internet Gaming Entertainment Ltd (IGE). Started for digitial assets in the game EverQuest, [IGE offered not only the virtual commodities in exchange for real money but also provided professional customer service.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_economy#Black_market). A very lucrative underground market of virtual commodities, a so called [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_economy#Black_market](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_economy#Black_market) emerged with IGE enjoying a central position. Going against game manufacturer's terms and condition, IGE was on the edge of legality. Big players of the gaming industry, with Blizzard Entertainement on the forefront, went into a raging battle starting in 2007 to try to put an end to this "black market". This secondary market has shrinked a lot since then due to these efforts.

Part of the efforts to circumvent the secondary market was to include such virtual assets trading features inside the game it self and to modify the game monetization strategies accordingly. For exemple, in 2011, Blizzard introduced its own market place for digital assets inside Diablo III via a currency-based auction house call the Auction House. Later, [by 2015, Blizzard attempted to stabilize the in-game economy of World of Warcraft by introducing the WoW Token, which let players exchange virtual gold for real currency.](https://cryptobriefing.com/video-games-mining-cryptocurrency/). This showes that the big players of the industry has realized that its is not worth going againts this trend and that they should instead try to make a profit out of it. 

But the in-game token is not a cryptoeconomic token. Since the code converning the exchanges is closed-source and the trading history is stored on centralized server, these tokens lacks the transparency features provided by the blockchain back-end and open-source code. For the average consumer, transparency is not that much of an issue, but for players having a lot of stake in the game, it can be a major concern. More and more gamers in the community start to be worried about transparency of these tokens and start to be sensible to the advantages blockchain technologies can bring to their gaming experience.

### Gamers as early adopters
The proportion of token holders in the gaming community is very high compared to the general public. This represents a bassin of potential early adopters for blockchain technologies.

### The current state of blockchain games
Since the release of Ethereum in 2015, we have wintness the emerge of games on the blockchain which fullfill these transparency requirements. The popularity of these blockchain games is undeniable (crypto zombies, crypto kitties, etc.) despite the obvious lack of gameplay of these early games and their primitive game mechanics. Blockchain games are here to stay and will become more and more diverse beyong simple "hot potato style" and speculative games. Monetization of in games assets is one of the first convincing use case of the blockchain beyong Bitcoin.

### Now the main focus of the workshop: user experience 
Blockchain games demands high performance on the underlying back-end to offer seamless experience to the user (high transaction rate, secure private key and account management, low or unexistant transaction fees). These concerns are at the hearth of wide spread blockchain adoption in the near future.

3. The gaming industry has changed a lot lately with the incredible popularity of mobile games. Monetization of games have also evolved a lot and will continue to do so.  blockchain technology might be the next big thing in that space. The gaming market is huge and e-sports popularity is growing.
