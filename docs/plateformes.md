# Comparing three Daap plateforms for game devellopement

Now that we have some experience with the developpement of a blockchain game, we will now compare three decentralized application devellopement plateforms in terms of the three issues raised before, namely, transaction fees, transaction rate and account security.

|  | Platform            | Consensus algorythm      | Features |Transaction fees| Transaction rate | Decentralization | Security |
|---|---------------------|---------------------------|---|-------|---|---|---|
|1.| The Ethereum Network | Currently Proof-of-work (PoW) | Strong network effect | High | Low | High | Highest |
|2.| The Loom Network    | Customizable Delegated Proof-of-State (DPoS) on Ethereum (PoW) sidechains | Plasma |Low | High | Low | Low |
|3.| EOS | Delegated Proof-of-Stake with possibility of customizable sidechains | Account recovery options built-in | unknown for now | High | Low | High |


blockchain technology might be the next big thing in that space. The gaming market is huge and e-sports popularity is growing.
